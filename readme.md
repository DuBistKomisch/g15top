Tested with Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Express.

It should build out of the box, assuming you have the Windows libraries available.

However, before you run it, you'll need a copy LogitechLcd.dll into the build directory. (or just put it in somewhere in your %PATH%)

Obviously the Logitech Gaming Software will need to be installed and running for it to actually do anything.
